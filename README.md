# Mapping_Earthquakes
Unit 13 - Visualizing Earthquakes

The purpose of this project is to visually show the differences between the magnitudes of earthquakes, tectonic plates, and major earthquakes all over the world for the last seven days.   

Using JavaScript and the D3.js library to retrieve the coordinates and magnitudes of the earthquakes from the GeoJSON data.   Leaflet library was then utilized to plot the data on a Mapbox map through an API request and interactivity was created for the earthquake data.

The map is interactive in that is has a D3.js layer for earthquakes, tectonic plates as well as major earthquakes.    The interactivity continues with three visual layers:  streets, satellites, and dark.
